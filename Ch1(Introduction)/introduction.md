# Introduction
## OVERVIEW
* Computer Science can be viewed as the study of algorithms. This study encompasses four distinct areas:
    1. Machines for executing algorithms - study of various forms of machine fabrication and organization so that algorithms can be effectively carried out.
    2. Language for describing algorithms - These languages can be placed on a continuum (continuous sequence in which adjacent elements are not perceptibly(in a way that can be seen heard or noticed) different from each other but the extremes are quite distinct).
